# Building on remote1.student.chalmers.se (or equivalent)

The only dependency is lens. Install it with:

```
cabal install --user --reorder-goals lens
```

If lens already installed, but the compile still fails, try 

```
ghc-pkg list
```

If the `mtl` package appears in both the system list and the user list, 
there is a version conflict due to a (known) cabal bug, 
and some clever tinkering with ghc-pkg unregister or a 
deletion of .ghc/* and .cabal/lib is in order.
